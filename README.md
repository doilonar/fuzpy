# Fuzpy
In programming and software development, fuzzing or fuzz testing is an automated software testing technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a computer program. The program is then monitored for exceptions such as crashes, failing built-in code assertions, or potential memory leaks. 

This script is written in python2 and generate random data to send to the server. The last packet sent to the server will be saved.
